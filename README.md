##  Objective
The goal of this project is to build the **memory system** of an AI Research Assistant.
Designed a **semantic search engine** that retrieves academic documents based on
meaning rather than keywords.

This phase focuses on:
- Document embeddings
- Vector databases
- Semantic retrieval
- Retrieval quality analysis

##  Tasks Overview

### GUI-Based Data Selection
GUI  allows the user to:
- Upload or select a dataset (minimum 10–15 text documents)
- View dataset statistics (number of documents, size)
  

### Embedding & Vector Store Configuration
The GUI allows the user to select:
- A Hugging Face embedding model
- A vector database (FAISS or Chroma)

Based on these selections:
- Generates embeddings
- Stores them using LangChain

### Semantic Retrieval
Application provides:
- A query input box
- A configurable `top-k` value
- Clearly ordered retrieval results based on relevance

### Retrieval Evaluation & Analysis
Test your system with:
- Multiple queries
- Different datasets
- Different embedding models
